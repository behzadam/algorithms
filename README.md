## Introduction

It includes code and patterns from the "JavaScript Algorithms" repository, translated from JavaScript to TypeScript. [JavaScript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)

### Data structure

- [Comparator](src/ds/comparator/comparator.ts)
- [HashTable](src/ds/hash-table/hash-table.ts)
- [MinHeap](src/ds/heap/min-heap.ts)
- [MaxHeap](src/ds/heap/max-heap.ts)
- [LinkedList](src/ds/linked-list/linked-list.ts)
- [Queue](src/ds/queue/queue.ts)
- [Stack](src/ds/stack/stack.ts)
- [MaxPriorityQueue](src/ds/priority-queue/max-priority-queue.ts)
- [MinPriorityQueue](src/ds/priority-queue/min-priority-queue.ts)
- [Trie](src/ds/trie/trie.ts)
- [BinarySearch](src/ds/ds/binary-search/binary-search.ts)
- [LinearSearch](src/ds/linear-search/linear-search.ts)

Please note that the repository is still a work in progress, and new algorithms and patterns will be added over time.
